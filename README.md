# SortingVisualizer

This Sorting Visualizer is a web-based application that allows user to visualize sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort and Heap Sort in action. It provides an interactive and intuitive way to understand how different sorting algorithms work and observe the step-by-step sorting process.

# Features:
- Supports multiple sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Heap Sort.
- Real-time visualization of the sorting process using visual elements such as bars.
- Adjustable array size and speed control to customize the sorting experience.
- Random array generation for testing and comparing different sorting algorithms.
- Clear visualization of algorithm comparisons, swaps, and overall progress.

# Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end implementation.
- Responsive design to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.


Contributing:
Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs, have suggestions for improvements, or would like to add new sorting algorithms, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

# Acknowledgments:
This project was inspired by the need to visualize sorting algorithms and gain a better understanding of their inner workings. Special thanks to the creators of sorting algorithm visualizers and related educational resources for their inspiration and guidance.
